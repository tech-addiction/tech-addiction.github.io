I believe my biggest struggle for wasting time on the computer comes from browsing the internet. A lot of that struggle comes from when I open up my web browser, and in the omnibar (address bar) I type in any letter, all of a sudden I am hit with suggestions of what to search for and previously visited sites that match that letter.

This usually leads me a stray from my initial task to quickly clicking on a previously visited site. One way to combat this is to clear the browser cache, so these previous websites do not show up when I type.

If you are using Chrome you can go to this web address `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData` to quickly clear your cache.

However, I wanted a way to clear the cache without having to manually do it.

I just used some AppleScript code to automate opening Chrome to that webadress then AppleScript sends the "Enter" keystroke.

You can find the applescript file [here on Github](https://github.com/tech-addiction/MacOSX-Chrome-Clear-Cache) or download a .zip of the files via [Direct Download](https://github.com/tech-addiction/MacOSX-Chrome-Clear-Cache/archive/main.zip))

Instructions how to use the AppleScript code is [here on Github](https://github.com/tech-addiction/MacOSX-Chrome-Clear-Cache#usage).

Hope this helps you and/or inspires you to use the computer less!
